# Pointers-in-C

What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. 

Syntax of C Pointers
datatype * pointer_name;

How to Use Pointers?
To use pointers in C, we must understand below two operators:

1. Addressof Operator
The addressof operator ( & ) is a unary operator that returns the address of its operand. Its operand can be a variable, function, array, structure, etc.

Syntax of Address of Operator
&variable_name;

2. Dereferencing Operator
The dereference operator ( * ), also known as the indirection operator is a unary operator. It is used in pointer declaration and dereferencing.
